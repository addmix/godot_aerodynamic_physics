- Enable plugin in project settings `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`

> [Advanced installation](docs/advanced_install.md)


## Basic Usage
- Add an ![AeroBody3D icon](icons/AeroBody3D.svg) AeroBody to your scene, and add one or more ![AeroInfluencer3D icon](icons/AeroInfluencer3D.svg) AeroInfluencer3D derived classes as children, adjust settings to change the characteristics.

## Development Direction
1. Usability, stability, and performance.
2. More AeroInfluencer3D derived nodes (Dynamic rotor systems, primitive shapes, fuselages).
3. Aerofoil profiles for AeroSurfaces.
4. Energyâ€“maneuverability graphs and aircraft performance profiling.
5. And [More](CONTRIBUTING.md/#future-features)
